## Schema

### Required

- `domain_name` (String) The domain name of the alias to manage.
- `local_part` (String) The local part of the alias to manage.

### Optional

- `destinations` (List of String) List of email addresses that act as destinations of the alias.
- `destinations_punycode` (List of String) List of email addresses that act as destinations of the alias. Use this attribute instead of `destinations` in case you want/must use the punycode representation of your domain.
- `expirable` (Boolean) Whether this alias expires at some time.
- `expires_on` (String) The expiration date of this alias.
- `is_internal` (Boolean) Internal aliases can only receive emails from Migadu email servers.
- `remove_upon_expiry` (Boolean) Whether to remove this alias upon expiry.

### Read-Only

- `address` (String) Contains the email address `local_part@domain_name` as returned by the Migadu API. This might be different from the `id` attribute in case you are using international domain names. The Migadu API always returns the punycode version of a domain.
- `id` (String) Contains the value `local_part@domain_name`.
